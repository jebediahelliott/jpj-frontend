        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          I developed a deep love and respect for dogs at an early age. My family had German Shepherds throughout my childhood that were my favorite companions. At 13, I got a Siberian Husky named Max. Max lived for 19 years and was a great teacher in my life. After Max passed on, I rescued a German Shepherd named, curiously enough, Max. Max had many challenging issues, but with patience, love, a healthy lifestyle, and training, he too became a wonderful dog. I will forever be indebted to both Max’s. They were the driving inspiration behind my desire to help people do the best they can for their dogs.

          I pursued my life’s dream in 1999 to learn more about training dogs and did an apprenticeship with Randy Kromer of Kromerhaus Kennels. It was here that I learned to train dogs at all levels. In April of 2011 I stopped training dogs in Pennsylvania and in June of that year moved to Florida to start a rescue and rehabilitation facility. The rescue facility focused on dogs that were on death row, had behavioral issues, and were not eligible for adoption or rescue.

          Running the rescue facility was a wonderful and rewarding experience, but after 5 years of the Florda heat and missing our home in the North, we decided to move back to Central Pennsylvania. In October of 2016 we picked up where we left off, helping people to train their dogs, have fun with their dogs, and achieve their goals.

          I have now been a professional dog trainer for 18 years. I continue to train owners and their dogs in Obedience and Behavior Modification, AKC Obedience, Tracking, Search and Rescue, Personal Protection, and Police K-9. I believe that it is a trainer’s job to save dogs’ lives. Lack of training is the number one killer of dogs. My job as a trainer is to educate owners to effectively communicate with their dogs so they can enjoy a relationship with their companions as friends and family members.
